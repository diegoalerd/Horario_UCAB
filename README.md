## HORARIO UCAB

### Summary
The "Horario UCAB" project aims to allow UCAB students to efficiently and easily organize their class schedules. The system enables students to search for and individually select the courses they wish to take, while providing alerts for possible schedule conflicts. In addition, students may add extra activities such as sports, clubs, or work, so that the system can evaluate their availability accordingly.

It is expected that this system will provide a solution for students that facilitates the management of their time and schedules, allowing them to achieve better academic and personal organization.
